# ✨ Yui's GlazeWM Config

Welcome to my personal GlazeWM configuration!  
This setup focuses on **aesthetics and minimalism** over functionality tweaks.  

All key bindings are left as default — just visual enhancements and UI refinements for a minimal and clean experience.

> ⚠️ Note: This config is **still evolving** and subject to change as I continue customizing.

## 🧠 About GlazeWM

This configuration is made for [glzr-io/glazewm](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) — a modern tiling window manager for Windows.  

All credit for the project goes to the developers and maintainers of [glzr-io/glazewm](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm).  
This repository contains **only my personal configuration** and visual customizations.
